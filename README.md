# pet-feeder-project-NEW
This is the Github part (Section 2) of the IIT Assignment, I am tasked to create the folders for each step that is in the assignments  and then add images of my diagrams and data table from the report into the Github.

The contents in the repository comes from section 1 of my IIT Assignment and follows the instructions of section 2 where I have to separate each step of section 1 into different folders which are:
Step 1: Understanding and Defining the problem (Analyze)
Step 2: Organize and Describe the data (Organize)
Step 3: Plan the Solution (Design the Algorithm)
Step 4: Implement the Solution (Implementation)
Step 5: Test and Refine Solutions (Testing)

I've copied over everything from Section 1 of the report, but did not add in anything from Section 3
to prevent any issues regarding visibility I made sure to make this repository public. For anyone who sees this other than the tutor, this is mostly wordcode.

My "design" was made as a three-container, pet feeder with one bowl, set to dispense food for different pets. the reason its a three container one is that 
it is not a good idea to mix two-three different foods in one container.

as part of the task is related to asking AI to help in making a professional readme, these were the results. Some of the AI's results are wrong therefore either weren't included. or remade/edited to look better:

üêæ Pet Feeder Project
Overview
This project is a DIY automated pet feeder designed to dispense food at scheduled times using programmable hardware and software. It aims to simplify pet care by allowing users to set feeding schedules and control dispensing mechanisms, potentially using a Raspberry Pi or similar microcontroller.

Features:
- üïí Scheduled Feeding: Automate feeding times to ensure consistent nutrition for your pet.
- üìÅ Modular Design: Organized into clear development steps for easy understanding and expansion.
- üß™ Prototype Ready: Includes analysis and planning files to guide implementation.

Getting Started
To begin using or contributing to this project:
- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/RavsTheMilkAddict/pet-feeder-project-NEW.git
- run the program
- Add real-time scheduling interface
- Integrate sensors for food level detection
- Enable remote control via mobile or web app or integrate a system into the feeder that allows its use through a physical device

Contributing
Feel free to fork the project and submit pull requests. Contributions are welcome to improve hardware design, software logic, or documentation.
