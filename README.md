# pet-feeder-project-NEW
This is the Github part (Section 2) of the IIT Assignment, I am tasked to create the folders for each step that is in the assignments (Step 1, Step 3, and step 4) 
and then add images from the report into the Github.

I've copied over everything from Section 1 but did not add in anything from Section 3
to prevent any issues regarding visibility I made sure to make this repository public, for anyone who sees this other than the tutor, this is mostly wordcode.

as part of the task is related to asking AI to help in making a professional readme, these were the results. Some of the AI's results are wrong therefore either weren't included. or remade/edited to look better:

🐾 Pet Feeder Project
Overview
This project is a DIY automated pet feeder designed to dispense food at scheduled times using programmable hardware and software. It aims to simplify pet care by allowing users to set feeding schedules and control dispensing mechanisms, potentially using a Raspberry Pi or similar microcontroller.

Features:
- 🕒 Scheduled Feeding: Automate feeding times to ensure consistent nutrition for your pet.
- 📁 Modular Design: Organized into clear development steps for easy understanding and expansion.
- 🧪 Prototype Ready: Includes analysis and planning files to guide implementation.

Getting Started
To begin using or contributing to this project:
- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/RavsTheMilkAddict/pet-feeder-project-NEW.git
- run the program
- Add real-time scheduling interface
