STEP 1: Understanding and Defining the Problem

The features:
-The feeder must have the ability to pour in food for the pets.
 
-it should be able to schedule when the food is poured, the ability to set multiple time schedules and the types of food.

-The ability to alert staff when: food is running low on the container, the pets have stopped eating, food is dispensing more than the allotted amount, 
 food failed to dispense 


In order to monitor whether the pets are eating their food or not, a weight measurer will be installed on the device. 

INPUTS:
-Schedule
-Food type
-How much food is left in the container (food level sensor)
-How much food is left in the bowl (Weight sensor)
-Whether food is dispensed or not (Food dispenser sensor)

OUTPUTS:
-The food
-The alert system

POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS:


No ability to pour food on the same time frame (i.e soft cat food and hard cat food can’t be done in the same hour or half hour)

A chance that pets from later schedules may get less food due to previous foods not fully finished by the previous group of pets 
(if the bowl is left uncleaned by staff). 

There’s no actual way to check whether the pet is eating the food or not, the staff can only guess by the alert about the bowl’s 
weight being unchanged for more than a certain amount of time.
