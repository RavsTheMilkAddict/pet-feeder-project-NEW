Following examples from the assignment and adding some more, these test cases and their results are (and should be):

-Pet eats as expected:
When pet eats as expected, BWeight (bowl weight) should be at 0 in around 10 minutes(or set to a realistic value) 

- Pet does not eat:
There will be an alert that food is either: below set threshold or within set threshold for more than 10 minutes

-Food container is empty:
There will be an alert

-Schedule set within the same timeframe:
There will be an alert and the user will have to redo the process

-There is still food left in the bowl:
There will be an alert but user can choose to either continue anyway or not, it’ll also keep pouring if there’s no response after 3 minutes

-There is not enough food in the container:
There will be an alert but it will continue pouring until the set threshold or until there is no food left unless user chooses othewrise.
